In this project, I have did the following: 
● Implemented GDSII files for MIPS and RISC-V processor designs, successfully navigating all steps of the ASIC flow.
● Met timing constraints and optimized area, achieving a chip power consumption of 2.7 mW.
● Implemented GDSII files for the same architectures using the ISE tool with Spartan 6 FPGA Kit, successfully completing
the FPGA flow for comparison with the ASIC flow in terms of area and power.# MIPSvsRISC-V_ASIC
